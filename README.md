# COMP484 | Web Engineering I

Forming effective study groups over long distances is not easy when taking online classes, especially if students do not take an initiative to establish communication to form study groups. Therefore, a web app with a virtual chat room that allows students to connect and collaborate similarly to how they would in a study group would be beneficial.

We plan to add to and integrate this chat room into our larger senior design project in Comp 490.
